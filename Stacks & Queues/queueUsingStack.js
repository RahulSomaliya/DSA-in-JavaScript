// Interview que: implement queues using stacks
// hint: it would be easier when the stacks are implemented with arrays, however, I'll do them both (linked-lists as well as arrays)

// FIXME: It looks like I won't be able to import the Queue class without the module structure.

// import Queue from '../Stacks & Queues/implementQueue';
import * as queue from './implementQueue.js';

// const dummyQueue = new Queue();
// console.log(`ðŸ’Ž dummyQueue: `, dummyQueue);
console.log(`ðŸ’Ž queue: `, queue);
